\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented Cued-Agent, a novel end-to-end lip reading system based on the Conformer architecture. Our key contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Dynamic Feature Module that explicitly models lip movement velocity and acceleration.
    \item A Semantic Alignment mechanism using contrastive learning for visual-text correspondence.
    \item An EMA training strategy for improved generalization.
\end{itemize}

Experiments on the MVLRS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with 21.2\% WER and 12.7\% CER. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Future work includes extending to audio-visual settings and exploring self-supervised pre-training strategies.
